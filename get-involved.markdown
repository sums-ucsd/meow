# Get Involved

In case of conflicting information, the constitution takes priority.

## Volunteering

If you would like to help run our events, we post event volunteer opportunities on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XVVeGHXGTt).

## Becoming a Member

Anyone can attend our events but an eligible student may become a SUMS member for additional benefits.
